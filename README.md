## Overview

In this project, I have implemented a classifier using deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks  and transfer learning to classify traffic signs. I have trained a model so that it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I have tested my model program on new images of traffic signs collected from the web and captured images of traffic sign locally collected from a friend.

## Dataset

1. [Download the dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.
